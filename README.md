# NextJS_WebAccessibility ðŸ‘“

#### This project was developed following the course of [@rockeatseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) Accessibility with ReactJS ðŸ’¡

â„¹ _The objective of this project is to work on the issue of accessibility in the development of projects, ensuring access to all audiences (speech, visual, auditory, cognitive, neurological or physical impaired, who must be able to understand, navigate and interact and contribute with the web)._

#### ðŸ“Œ The accessibility scanner was made using the following tools:

- [Axe Accessibility](https://www.deque.com/axe/) | [via dev console](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/react)

- [Landmark Navigation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/landmark-navigation-via-k/ddpokpbjopmeeiiolheejjpkonlkklgp)

- [Screen Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn)

â„¹ _It is worth remembering that tools are not enough to deal with accessibility, it is necessary to imagine real scenarios such as: being without a device, vision problems, among other contents that you can learn more about at [W3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/), the tip is always to seek inspiration in large projects that already have these themes already addressed and running in production_
